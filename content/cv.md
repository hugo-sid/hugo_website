# # hello world
This website was created as an experiment and a way for me to keep track of the various pieces of content I create or am featured in. Occasionally I am interviewed for a newspaper or podcast, or I sometimes create my own texts and technical documentation. The idea is to share useful content on an irregular basis.  
When creating this website, my focus was to use a simple framework that allows me to publish content quickly and easily. Therefore, I use the Hugo Framework to generate static web pages and host them on Google Cloud. Google Cloud allows through the services Cloud Build and Cloud Run to create and publish a container very easily, quickly, and cost-efficiently. I outlined the exact workflow in my first post.
